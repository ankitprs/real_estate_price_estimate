# Bangalore Real Estate Price Prediction

[Project Link ðŸ”—](https://realestatepriceestimate.streamlit.app)

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict real estate prices in Bangalore, India. The model uses a dataset of historical real estate data from Bangalore, including various features such as location, size, amenities, and more, to make accurate predictions of property prices.

The project is deployed using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications with minimal effort. Users can interact with the model through a user-friendly web interface to get price predictions for properties in different areas of Bangalore.

2. Install the required Python packages:

### Usage

1. Run the Streamlit web application:

``` bash
    streamlit run index.py
```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

3. Use the web interface to input property features (location, size, amenities, etc.), and the model will predict the property price.


### Data


The dataset used for training and testing the model is included in the data directory. The dataset contains the following columns:

1. location: The location of the property.
2. size: The size of the property (e.g., 2 BHK, 3 BHK).
3. total_sqft: The total square footage of the property.
4. bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the property.
5. price: The price of the property (the target variable).


### Model

The machine learning model used for price prediction is implemented in the `real estate pricing.ipynb` file. It is trained on the provided dataset and uses various regression techniques to make predictions.
